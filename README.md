# OfficePulse

## Description

**OfficePulse** is a lightweight internal communication app designed for small and medium-sized companies.  
It allows employees to create accounts, log in securely, and exchange instant text messages in a shared workspace.

Authentication and session management are handled through **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**, ensuring data privacy and secure access to protected routes.

Built with **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Supabase**, the app provides real-time messaging, clean design, and modern web security practices.  
Deployed on **Vercel** for performance and reliability.

## Planned Features

- Secure file sharing between users
- Role-based permissions (Admin, Employee)
- Private team channels

**OfficePulse** demonstrates how a minimal yet functional prototype (MVP) can evolve into a complete office communication suite.
